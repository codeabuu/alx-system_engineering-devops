Tasks
0. Install MySQL
mandatory
First things first, let’s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.

MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x
Make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status
Please make sure you have your README.md pushed to GitHub.
Example:

ubuntu@229-web-01:~$ mysql --version
mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.25, for Linux (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$
Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops
Directory: 0x14-mysql
   
1. Let us in!
mandatory
In order for us to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.

Create a MySQL user named holberton_user on both web-01 and web-02 with the host name set to localhost and the password projectcorrection280hbtn. This will allow us to access the replication status on both servers.
Make sure that holberton_user has permission to check the primary/replica status of your databases.
In addition to that, make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. You will likely need to add the public key to web-02 as you only added it to web-01 for this project. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status
Example:

ubuntu@229-web-01:~$ mysql -uholberton_user -p -e "SHOW GRANTS FOR 'holberton_user'@'localhost'"
Enter password:
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for holberton_user@localhost                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'holberton_user'@'localhost' |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$
Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops
Directory: 0x14-mysql
   
2. If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes
mandatory
In order for you to set up replication, you’ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.

Create a database named tyrell_corp.
Within the tyrell_corp database create a table named nexus6 and add at least one entry to it.
Make sure that holberton_user has SELECT permissions on your table so that we can check that the table exists and is not empty.
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$ mysql -uholberton_user -p -e "use tyrell_corp; select * from nexus6"
Enter password:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
|  1 | Leon  |
+----+-------+
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$
Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops
Directory: 0x14-mysql
   
3. Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?
mandatory
Before you get started with your primary-replica synchronization, you need one more thing in place. On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.

The name of the new user should be replica_user, with the host name set to %, and can have whatever password you’d like.
replica_user must have the appropriate permissions to replicate your primary MySQL server.
holberton_user will need SELECT privileges on the mysql.user table in order to check that replica_user was created with the correct permissions.
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$ mysql -uholberton_user -p -e 'SELECT user, Repl_slave_priv FROM mysql.user'
+------------------+-----------------+
| user             | Repl_slave_priv |
+------------------+-----------------+
| root             | Y               |
| mysql.session    | N               |
| mysql.sys        | N               |
| debian-sys-maint | Y               |
| holberton_user   | N               |
| replica_user     | Y               |

4. Setup a Primary-Replica infrastructure using MySQL
mandatory


Having a replica member on for your MySQL database has 2 advantages:

Redundancy: If you lose one of the database servers, you will still have another working one and a copy of your data
Load distribution: You can split the read operations between the 2 servers, reducing the load on the primary member and improving query response speed
Requirements:
MySQL primary must be hosted on web-01 - do not use the bind-address, just comment out this parameter
MySQL replica must be hosted on web-02
Setup replication for the MySQL database named tyrell_corp
Provide your MySQL primary configuration as answer file(my.cnf or mysqld.cnf) with the name 4-mysql_configuration_primary
Provide your MySQL replica configuration as an answer file with the name 4-mysql_configuration_replica
Tips:
Once MySQL replication is setup, add a new record in your table via MySQL on web-01 and check if the record has been replicated in MySQL web-02. If you see it, it means your replication is working!
Make sure that UFW is allowing connections on port 3306 (default MySQL port) otherwise replication will not work.
Example:

web-01
ubuntu@web-01:~$ mysql -uholberton_user -p
Enter password:

5. MySQL backup
mandatory


What if the data center where both your primary and replica database servers are hosted are down because of a power outage or even worse: flooding, fire? Then all your data would inaccessible or lost. That’s why you want to backup and store them in a different system in another physical location. This can be achieved by dumping your MySQL data, compressing them and storing them in a different data center.

Write a Bash script that generates a MySQL dump and creates a compressed archive out of it.

Requirements:

The MySQL dump must contain all your MySQL databases
The MySQL dump must be named backup.sql
The MySQL dump file has to be compressed to a tar.gz archive
This archive must have the following name format: day-month-year.tar.gz
The user to connect to the MySQL database must be root
The Bash script accepts one argument that is the password used to connect to the MySQL database
Example:

ubuntu@03-web-01:~$ ls
5-mysql_backup
ubuntu@03-web-01:~$ ./5-mysql_backup mydummypassword
backup.sql
ubuntu@03-web-01:~$ ls
01-03-2017.tar.gz  5-mysql_backup  backup.sql
ubuntu@03-web-01:~$ more backup.sql
